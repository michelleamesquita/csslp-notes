# Exam Outline Review

## 1. Secure Software Concepts

### 1.1 Core Concepts

- **Confidentiality**
  - Covert channel: communication path that is intentionally hidden. Leaves almost no trace. Receiver has to be actively listening for message
  - Overt channel: communication path that is not hidden. Leaves evidence behind but receiver doesn't have to be listening for message
  - Side channel: unintentional communication. Think power consumption changes to get information about encryption used
- **Integrity**
  - Also includes stability and reliability for authorized subjects
- **Availability**
- **Authentication**
- **Authorization**
- **Accountability**
- **Nonrepudiation**

### 1.2 Security Design Principles

- **Least Privilege**

- **Economy of mechanism**
  - less complexity is better
  - eliminate nonessential services and protocols
- **Complete mediation**
  - authorization cannot by bypassed
  - authorization checked every time subject requests access to an object
- **Open design**
  - security of a system is independent of the design (don't rely on security by obscurity)
  - Kerckhoffs's principle: security of a cryptosystem is reliant on choice of keys, not algorithm
- **Least common mechanism**
  - isolation to protect against sharing of information
- **Psychological acceptability**
- **Component reuse**
- **Diversity of defense**
  - layers of defense should be diverse
- **Safeguard**
  - _Proactive_ controls to protect assets
  - controls can be physical, administrative, or technical
