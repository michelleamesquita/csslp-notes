# Defensive Coding Practices

## Declarative vs Programmatic (imperative) Security

- early design decision
- Declarative
  - define the what
  - Security is defined in the deployment, not the code itself
  - Managed by ops team, not dev team
  - more flexible security
- Imperative
  - embedded into code
  - less flexible/portable/reusable but allows for greater granularity

### Bootstrapping

- startup process when computer/program starts

### Cryptographic Agility

- allow for changes in crypto function (e.g. algorithm) without changing code
- also assists with international cryptography reqs
- early design decision
- **important to use secure sessions**

### Handling Configuration Parameters

- securing config files is an important design decision

## Memory Management

- ASLR (address space layout randomization) is used to defend aggainst attacks by breaking memory localy: local attacks

- shared responsibility between app and OS
- managed code applications (.NET, Java) handle memory management

### Type-safe Practice

- type safety is linked to memory safety: cannot access arbitrary locations of memory

### Locality

- when a program references memory, other references are generally predictable and in close proximity
- several memory attacks take advantage of locality

## Error Handling

### Exception Management

- if left to the OS to handle, privilege escalation and other issues can occur

## Interface Coding

- need appropriate AuthN and AuthZ
- audit externally exposed, privileged operations

## Primary Mitigations

- standard best practice mitigations:
  - lock down env
  - establish/maintain control of inputs
  - establish/maintain control of outputs
  - assume external components can be undermined
  - assume code can be read by anyone
  - use libraries and frameworks that avoid introducing weaknesses
  - use industry-accepted security features
  - integrate security into the entire SDLC
  - use mix of methods to find and prevent weaknesses

### Defensive Coding

Foundational:

- attack surface reduction
- understand common coding vulns
- implement standard mitigations

Other:

- code analysis
- code review
- versioning
- crypto agility
- memory mgmt
- exception handling
- interface coding
- managed code

Exam tips:

- controlling concurrency (access to shared objects/race conditions)
- tokenization for sensitive data
- the actual handling of an out-of-range calculation is best performed by exception handling on
the range value itself.

## Learning from Past Mistakes

- security team should regularly update security reqs while considering errors from other companies

## RASP

- mitigate attacks in real-time
