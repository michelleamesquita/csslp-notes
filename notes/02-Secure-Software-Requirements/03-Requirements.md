# Requirements

## 📝 Functional Requirements

- business reqs
- IT reqs (e.g. database, environment, DR/BCP)
- org reqs (e.g. coding standards, maintainability)
- security reqs

### Role and User Definitions

- which user groups are allowed access, and to what functionality
- part of the use-case definition
- users = subjects

### Objects

- ensures members of dev team can use common set of objects and control appropriately

### Activities/Actions

- Each object in a system should have all possible activities/actions defined + documented

### Subject-Object-Activity Matrix

- 📝 helps establish relationships between users and objects
- creates list of allowable actions and another list of denied actions

### Use cases

- a specific example of an intended behavior of the system, usually for complex/confusing/ambiguous situations
- not intended for all subject-object interactions
- not a substitute for documenting specific reqs
- 📝 graphical format that shows intended behavior (ellipses) for actors (stick figures)
- 📝 best for business reqs that are poorly defined

### Abuse cases (inside and outside adversaries)

- form of use case but for the specifically prohibited

#### SAFECode

- development and distribution use cases - free, published PDF

### Sequencing and Timing Issues

- race conditions, infinite loops
- Means system is vulnerable to a Time of Check/Time of Use (TOC/TOU) attack
  - 📝 system does not use the value right after it checks the value, allowing for unauthorized manipulation
- 📝 To avoid race conditions, first identify race window and then design so processes are not called concurrently (mutual exclusion)
- 📝 infinite loops: caused by complex conditional logic with unhandled situations - all conditions in a nested loop should be handled in a positive fashion

### Secure Coding Standards

- Secure SDLC includes controlling processes and making repeatable
- Adopt secure development frameworks as part of SDLC
- 📝 each function should practice complete error mitigation
- logging standards for what, where, when

## Operational Requirements

- enterprise systems need to interact with and function alongside many other systems
- complete SDLC solution: secure by design, secure by default, secure in deployment
  - default configuration should be secure

### Deployment environment

- software is deployed to env that best suits its maintainability, data access, and access to needed services
- follow corporate standards for seamless inter-connectivity

## Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

- relationship between controls, test/verification effort and security requirement

- 📝 track and manage reqs and implementation details
- document relationships b/w security reqs, controls, and test/verify efforts
- predefined reqs for infra, security, data sources, etc for dev teams

## Connecting the dots

- easiest reqs are the features asked for
- also need to document implied reqs
- if the dev team should do something, needs to be listed in project reqs
