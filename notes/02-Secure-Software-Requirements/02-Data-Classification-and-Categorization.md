# Data Classification and Categorization

## Data Classification

- align protection and asset value associated with data
- it's a risk management tool 

types of classification:

- state
- use
- importance

**classification is for risk management** - reduce costs associated with protecting data

- match level of protection and cost with value of asset

### Data States

- at rest
- being created
- in transit
- being changed/deleted

data storage location should be considered as well

### Data usage

- determining how it is used can help determine how it should be shared (or not)

Usage classifications

- **Internal** - created, computed, stored (in memory) within application
- **Input** - read into system and possibly stored
- **Output** - written to output destination

Sensitivity categories

- **Security-sensitive** - subset of data, very valuable to attacker
- **PII**
- **Hidden** - concealed using obfuscation to protect from unauthorized disclosure

### Data Risk Impact

- 📝 labeled according to risk if lost (high, medium, low)
- will differ from firm to firm
- 📝 impact considerations include cost, operation impact, people impact, customer impact

## Data ownership

- it follows the business
- data is not owned by a person, it is owned by the enterprise
- data is assigned to people for stewardship/ownership for practical reasons
- **ownership is business driven**

### Owner

- acts in the interests of the enterprise
- determines who has what access
- owner != custodian (e.g. CFO owns accounting records but DBA can make direct changes)
- 📝 data owners define data classification, authorized users, access criteria, and security controls

### Custodian

- ensure processes safely transport, manipulate, and store data
- ensure data management processes (set by owner) are followed
- 📝 perform backups, data retention, disposal
- 📝 manage anything else (e.g. security controls) defined by owner
- custodians may not need read access

## Labeling

### Sensitivity

- built around business purpose

### Impact

- wider concern than sensitivity
- includes loss, disclosure, and alteration
- three levels (high, medium or moderate, low) - each level should be clearly defined
- 📝 NIST FIPS 199 and SP 800-18 provide framework for classifying based on CIA

#### Clearly Defining levels

- high: set high enough that a small number of data elements are included
- financial limits and customer impact vary, each company needs to decide for itself

## Types of data

### Structured

- has a defined structure that can be parsed, sorted, searched
- 📝 is not determined by where it is stored, but how
  - 📝 look for relationships between data elements

examples:

- tables in a database
- formatted file structures
- XML
- JSON
- certain text files like log files

### Unstructured

- not easily parsed/searched
- more difficult to modify outside originating application (word docs, pdfs)
- majority of data is unstructured

## Data lifecycle

- when data is not necessary, they encrypt it and plance in archival storage in case that needs to use

- cost of storing data is still a resource issue despite lower costs
- must be managed from backup, business continuity, disaster recovery perspective

### Generation

if data is going to be persistent, need to label, classify, protect

### Retention

if retained, must have metadata defined such as:

- data owner
- purpose of storing
- level of protection
- length of storage (retention policy)

protection must also consider how to protect backups and copies for DR

**System logs**: are considered important from a legal/compliance perspective, often have sensitive info that needs to be protected

### Disposal

primary purposes of disposal:

1. conserve resources
2. limit liabilities

📝 Length of storage is determined by:

1. business purpose
2. compliance

Legal hold data is not subject to normal disposal procedures

### Data agregation

- ensure data integrity and accuracy
