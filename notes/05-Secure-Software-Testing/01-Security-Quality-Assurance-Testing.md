# Security Quality Assurance Testing

quality = fitness for use according to requirements

## Standards for Software Quality Assurance

### ISO 9216

- primary focuses: functionality, reliability, usability
- other: efficiency, maintainability, portability

### ISO 9001
- Quality management 

### SSE-CMM

- **systems security engineering capability maturity model (aka ISO/IEC 21827)**
- de facto standard for evaluating security engineering capability in an org

### OSSTMM

- **Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual**
- peer-reviewed, scientific methodology

#### five sections

1. data networks
2. telecommunications
3. wireless
4. human (e.g. social engineering, security awareness training)
5. physical security

- training classes exist
- methodology can assist in auditing

## Testing Methodology

**Test harness**: means of documenting software, tools, test data, expected output, and configurations

- break testing into test suites for reuse

## Functional Testing

- identifying requirements that software is expect to perform, input test data. it envolves compliance with specifications and comparing actual with expected
- assess functionality as expected by end user

### Steps

1. Identify functions (reqs)
2. create test data
3. determine expected output
4. execute tests corresponding to functional reqs
5. compare actual and expected

### Functional Testing Areas

- reliability
- logic
- performance
- scalability

### Unit Testing

- it caches error earlier and ensure each unit stands on it own
- it test early detection

- functional logic
- understandable code
- reasonable vuln control and mitigation
- **done early by dev team before dev phase is over**

### Integration/Systems Testing

- includes secure and proper data transfer between components in a system

### Performance Testing

- **load testing**: performance under normal conditions
- **stress testing**: performance under overload conditions
- **Recoverability**: app's ability to restore itself to expected functionality after security is breached/bypassed

### Enviromental Testing

- all boundiries are identified and all errors with multiple modules are identified

### Regression Testing 
- dificult to choose better test portfolio

## Security Testing

### White-Box testing

- full knowledge of code and components
- done early in dev cycle
- focus on structure of software and use/misuse
- high false positives

### Black-Box testing

- common for system-level tests and pen testing
- focus on behavior of app
- high false positives

### Grey-Box Testing

- not total access to source code but understanding of inner workings
- rare outside of internal testing

## Environment

- interoperability of all components including:
  - credentials
  - permissions
  - access tokens
  - data movement across trust boundaries
  - etc

## Bug Tracking

- four types (same as options associated with risk):
  - removal of defect
  - mitigation
  - transfer of responsibility
  - ignore
- track bugs so they eventually get addressed
- logging bugs also provides metric of code quality
- defect categories:
  - bugs (coding errors)
  - flaws (design error)
  - behavioral anomalies (how app operates)
  - errors/faults (outcome-based from other sources)
  - vulns (things that can be manipulated to misuse system)

### Defects

- create defect database to track past and present issues
- help understand what not to do/what not to repeat
- provide testers with suggestions when looking for defects

### Bug Bar

- set minimum level of quality for security at beginning of project
- prevent certain well-defined defects from goind forward 
- it's necessary to prioritaze remediation work
- all bugs can be sources of compromise 
- improve utilization of security remediation

## Attack Surface Validation

- document actual attack surface through SDLC

## Test Data Lifecyle Management

- anonymization of production data iss very challenging and requires planning
