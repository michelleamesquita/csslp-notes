# Security Testing

## Scanning

Passive in nature

Example: OS fingerprinting

### Attack Surface Analyzer

Microsoft tool to analyze how Windows is impacted when app is installed

## Pen Testing

- Active testing
- purpose: provide details to dev team so root cause can be fixed

Steps:

1. Recon (discovery, enumeration)
2. attack and exploitation
3. removal of evidence
4. reporting

### Fuzzing

- brute-force, large number of inputs
- network protocols, file protocols, web protocols
- most browser errors are found via fuzzing
- block-box, white-box, or grey-box
- tests input validation vulns (e.g. XSS, injection)
- both generation-based and mutation-based are used and have different advantages

## Simulation Testing

- test in a pre-prod env
- all aspects (config, firewall, OS, load/performance, etc)
- test configuration errors or data issues

## Testing for Failure

- most testing is testing for failure - also important to test for incorrect values

## Crypto Validation

- crypto random numbers are essential - best from crypto libraries

### FIPS 140-2

- Federal Information Processing Standards
- selection of approved algorithms and implementation for federal gov

## Regression Testing

- more important as software gets older
- one of most time consuming parts of software patches
